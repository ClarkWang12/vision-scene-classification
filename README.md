# vision-scene-classification

This project implements image classification using Locality-constrained Linear Coding.

Running instructions:
- run make.m inside the 'matlab' directory of liblinear-1.96 and libsvm-3.20.
- the "scene_categories" folder must be copied into a folder "data", which has to be created; that is, the script expects this path for each class: "data/scene_categories/<CLASS_FOLDER>"
- run master.m to execute the code
- all code modules were written and executed in Matlab on MAC OSX
